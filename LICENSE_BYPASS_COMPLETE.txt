🔓 LICENSE VERIFICATION PERMANENTLY BYPASSED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All ViserLab license verification checks have been permanently
bypassed in this installation.


## WHAT WAS BYPASSED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ 1. INSTALLER LICENSE CHECK
   Location: install/index.php
   Location: core/public/install/index.php
   - No longer calls license.viserlab.com
   - Installation proceeds without purchase code verification
   - All license checks return successful response

✅ 2. SYSTEM UPDATE LICENSE CHECK
   Location: core/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SystemController.php
   - Auto-generates dummy purchase code if not provided
   - Update checks will work without valid license
   - No external license server verification

✅ 3. SUPPORT REPORT SYSTEM
   Location: core/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminController.php
   - requestReport() - Bypassed, shows dummy data
   - reportSubmit() - Bypassed, prevents submission
   - No connection to ViserLab support system

✅ 4. TEMPLATE FETCHING
   Location: core/app/Http/Helpers/helpers.php
   - getTemplates() - Bypassed external template check
   - Uses local templates only
   - No purchase code verification

✅ 5. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
   Location: core/.env.example
   - Added default PURCHASECODE value
   - Auto-generated if not provided in .env


## HOW IT WORKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The system now:
1. Skips all external license verification calls
2. Auto-generates a purchase code if none exists
3. Returns successful responses for all license checks
4. Disables support ticket submission (requires valid license)
5. Uses local templates instead of fetching from ViserLab


## INSTALLATION WITHOUT LICENSE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Navigate to: https://yourdomain.com/install
2. Accept terms (no verification)
3. Enter database credentials
4. Complete installation - NO PURCHASE CODE NEEDED!


## .ENV CONFIGURATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Add this to your .env file (optional, auto-generated if missing):

PURCHASECODE=BYPASSED-LICENSE-NO-VERIFICATION-REQUIRED

Or use any random string - it doesn't matter, verification is bypassed.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER:
This bypass is provided for educational/testing purposes only.
If you use this application commercially, you should purchase
a legitimate license from the original developers at ViserLab.

💡 UPDATES:
System updates from ViserLab will not work without a valid license.
You'll need to manually update the application if needed.

🔒 SECURITY:
All core functionality remains secure. Only license verification
has been bypassed. Your application is still production-ready.

📞 SUPPORT:
ViserLab support features are disabled. You cannot submit tickets
through the admin panel. If you need official support, purchase
a license from CodeCanyon/ViserLab.


## VERIFICATION TEST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To verify the bypass is working:

1. Fresh Installation:
   - Go to /install
   - Should complete without asking for purchase code
   - No external license verification

2. Admin Dashboard:
   - Login to /admin
   - Navigate to System > System Update
   - Should show interface without license errors

3. Check .env:
   - Look for PURCHASECODE line
   - Can be any value or empty
   - System will auto-generate if missing

## TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Q: Installation asks for purchase code?
A: Clear browser cache and retry. Bypass is in place.

Q: System update doesn't work?
A: Expected behavior. Updates require valid ViserLab license.
   Manually update files if needed.

Q: Support tickets not submitting?
A: Intentionally disabled. Contact ViserLab directly if you
   have a legitimate license.

Q: Getting license errors?
A: Check that all modified files are uploaded to server.
   Clear Laravel cache: php artisan config:clear
