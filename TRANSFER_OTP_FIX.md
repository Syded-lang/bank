# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Transfer OTP Emails Not Being Sent

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: Users were not receiving OTP emails when making transfers (own bank, other bank, wire transfer, DPS, FDR, airtime, withdrawals).

**Root Cause**: The `OTPManager::sendOtp()` method was sending notifications to the wrong object.

---

## Technical Explanation

### The Bug

In `core/app/Lib/OTPManager.php`, the `sendOtp()` method was calling:

```php
notify($this->parent, $verification->notify_template, $shortCodes, [$verification->send_via], false);
```

**Problem**: `$this->parent` was the parent object (Beneficiary, Plan, Operator, etc.) which **doesn't have an email field**.

### What Was Happening

When users tried to make transfers, the system would:

1. ✅ Create OTP verification record in database
2. ✅ Generate 6-digit OTP code
3. ❌ Try to send email to `Beneficiary` object (which has no email)
4. ❌ Email fails silently (no email address found)
5. ❌ User never receives OTP
6. ❌ User can't complete transfer

### Objects Being Passed

Different controllers passed different parent objects to `newOTP()`:

| Controller | Parent Object | Has Email? |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| OwnBankTransferController | `Beneficiary` | ❌ No |
| OtherBankTransferController | `Beneficiary` | ❌ No |
| WireTransferController | `WireTransferSetting` | ❌ No |
| DpsController | `Plan` (DPS) | ❌ No |
| FdrController | `Plan` (FDR) | ❌ No |
| AirtimeController | `Operator` | ❌ No |
| WithdrawController | `WithdrawMethod` | ❌ No |

**None of these objects have email fields!**

---

## The Fix

### Updated Code

```php
/**
 * Send the otp code to user's email or mobile
 *
 * @return void
 **/
public function sendOtp()
{
    if ($this->sendVia != '2fa') {
        $verification = $this->verification;
        $shortCodes   = ['otp' => $this->verification->otp];
        
        // OTP should always be sent to the authenticated user making the request
        // The $parent object (Beneficiary, Plan, Operator, etc.) doesn't have email
        $recipient = auth()->user();
        
        notify($recipient, $verification->notify_template, $shortCodes, [$verification->send_via], false);
    }
}
```

### What Changed

**Before**: `notify($this->parent, ...)`  
**After**: `notify(auth()->user(), ...)`

**Result**: OTP emails now sent to the **authenticated user** making the transfer/request.

## How It Works Now

### Transfer Flow (Example: Own Bank Transfer)

1. User fills transfer form:
   - Select beneficiary
   - Enter amount
   - See info: "Verification code will be sent to your email"

2. User clicks **Submit**

3. System:
   ```php
   // OwnBankTransferController.php
   $otpManager->newOTP($beneficiary, 'email', 'OWN_BANK_TRANSFER_OTP', [...]);
   
   // Inside OTPManager
   $otpVerification->otp = verificationCode(6); // e.g., "748291"
   $otpVerification->save();
   
   // sendOtp() is called
   $recipient = auth()->user(); // ✅ The logged-in user
   notify($recipient, 'OWN_BANK_TRANSFER_OTP', ['otp' => '748291'], ['email']);
   ```

4. Email sent to: **user's email address** ✅

5. User receives email:
   ```
   Subject: OTP for Own Bank Transfer
   
   Your verification code is: 748291
   
   Valid for: 5 minutes
   ```

6. User enters OTP on verification page

7. Transfer completed ✅

## Database Verification

### Check OTP Records

```sql
-- View recent OTP verifications
SELECT 
    id,
    user_id,
    send_via,
    notify_template,
    otp,
    send_at,
    expired_at,
    created_at
FROM otp_verifications
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**: Records with `send_via = 'email'` and 6-digit `otp` codes

---

### Check Notification Logs

```sql
-- View recent email notifications
SELECT 
    user_id,
    sent_from,
    sent_to,
    subject,
    mail_sender,
    created_at
FROM notification_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**: 
- `sent_to` = user's email address
- `subject` = "OTP for Own Bank Transfer" (or similar)
- Recent timestamps

---

## Email Template Verification

All these templates should exist in `notification_templates` table:

```sql
SELECT act, subject FROM notification_templates WHERE act LIKE '%OTP%';
```

**Expected Results**:
- `OWN_BANK_TRANSFER_OTP` - "OTP for Own Bank Transfer"
- `OTHER_BANK_TRANSFER_OTP` - "OTP for Other Bank Transfer Request"
- `WIRE_TRANSFER_OTP` - "OTP for Wire Transfer Request"
- `DPS_OTP` - "OTP for DPS Apply"
- `FDR_OTP` - "OTP for FDR Apply"
- `AIRTIME_OTP` - "OTP for Top-Up"
- `WITHDRAW_OTP` - "OTP for Withdraw"
- `LOGIN_OTP` - "Login OTP Code"

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Still not receiving OTP emails"

1. **Check email configuration**:
   ```bash
   ssh u299375718@37.44.246.142 -p 65002
   cd ~/domains/eastbridgeatlantic.com/public_html/core
   php artisan tinker --execute="dump(gs('mail_config'));"
   ```
   
   **Expected**:
   - `name: "smtp"`
   - `host: "smtp.hostinger.com"`
   - `port: 465`
   - `username: "info@eastbridgeatlantic.com"`

2. **Check email notifications enabled**:
   ```sql
   SELECT en FROM general_settings WHERE id = 1;
   ```
   **Expected**: `en = 1` (enabled)

3. **Check OTP email module enabled**:
   ```sql
   SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(modules, '$.otp_email') FROM general_settings WHERE id = 1;
   ```
   **Expected**: `1` (enabled)

4. **Check spam folder**: OTP emails might be filtered as spam

5. **Check user's email address**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, username, email, ev FROM users WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID;
   ```
   **Expected**: 
   - Valid email address
   - `ev = 1` (email verified)

6. **Test email sending**:
   - Go to Admin → **Notification → Email Settings**
   - Click **Send Test Mail**
   - Check if test email arrives

## Admin Control

### Enable/Disable OTP System

**Admin Panel → Settings → System Configuration → OTP Via Email**

- **Enabled (Green)**: All OTP emails sent ✅

### OTP Settings

- **OTP Time**: How long OTP is valid (default: 300 seconds / 5 minutes)
- **Email Notification**: Must be enabled for OTPs to work
- **Mail Configuration**: SMTP settings must be correct

## Security Implications

### ✅ Improved Security

**Before Fix**: OTP emails not sent → Users couldn't complete transfers  
**After Fix**: OTP emails sent to authenticated user → Secure 2-factor verification working

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in → Session created
2. User initiates transfer → `auth()->user()` returns logged-in user
3. OTP generated and sent to `auth()->user()->email`
4. User enters OTP → Verified
5. Transfer completed

**Security**: Only the authenticated user's email receives the OTP. No risk of sending to wrong recipient.
