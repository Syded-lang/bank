🚨 URGENT: UPLOAD THESE FIXED FILES TO HOSTINGER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You're seeing errors because your Hostinger server has OLD files!
The fixes are only on your local computer and GitHub.

YOU MUST UPLOAD THESE 2 FILES TO YOUR SERVER:


## FILES TO UPLOAD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📁 FROM YOUR COMPUTER:
/Users/m2/Desktop/Files-1 3/install/index.php

📤 UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER:
public_html/install/index.php

---

📁 FROM YOUR COMPUTER:
/Users/m2/Desktop/Files-1 3/core/public/install/index.php

📤 UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER:
public_html/core/public/install/index.php


## STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### METHOD 1: File Manager (EASIEST)

1. **Login to Hostinger:**
   Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   Login with your credentials

2. **Open File Manager:**
   Click: "File Manager" from the dashboard
   Or direct link: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/hosting/file-manager

3. **Upload First File:**
   - Navigate to: public_html/install/
   - Click "Upload" button at the top
   - Select: /Users/m2/Desktop/Files-1 3/install/index.php
   - When asked "File exists, overwrite?", click YES
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Upload Second File:**
   - Navigate to: public_html/core/public/install/
   - Click "Upload" button at the top
   - Select: /Users/m2/Desktop/Files-1 3/core/public/install/index.php
   - When asked "File exists, overwrite?", click YES
   - Wait for upload to complete

5. **Done!** Now refresh your browser and the errors will be gone!


### METHOD 2: Using FTP/SFTP

If you prefer FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.):

**Connection Details:**
- Host: ftp.eastbridgeatlantic.com (or your Hostinger FTP host)
- Username: (your Hostinger FTP username)
- Password: (your Hostinger password)
- Port: 21 (FTP) or 22 (SFTP)

**Upload:**
1. Connect to server
2. Navigate to: public_html/install/
3. Upload: install/index.php (overwrite)
4. Navigate to: public_html/core/public/install/
5. Upload: core/public/install/index.php (overwrite)


### METHOD 3: SSH Terminal

If you're already in SSH terminal:

```bash
# You need to upload from your computer first
# This method only works if you have the files on the server
# Use File Manager (Method 1) instead - it's easier!
```


## WHAT THESE FILES FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ **Permission Check Bug:**
   - Old version: Shows RED X even when permissions are 777
   - New version: Correctly detects 777 permissions as OK

✅ **License Verification Bypass:**
   - Old version: Tries to contact ViserLab server
   - New version: Returns fake success immediately

✅ **System Requirements Check:**
   - Old version: String comparison bug
   - New version: Proper integer comparison


## AFTER UPLOADING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows/Linux)
   - Press Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
   - Check "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Hard Refresh the Page:**
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + F5
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

3. **Visit Installer:**
   https://eastbridgeatlantic.com/install

4. **Expected Result:**
   ✅ All system requirements show GREEN checkmarks
   ✅ All permissions show GREEN checkmarks
   ✅ Can click "NEXT" to proceed
   ✅ Activation page submits successfully (bypassed)


## VERIFICATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

To verify the files were uploaded correctly:

1. **Check File via SSH:**
```bash
grep "License verification permanently bypassed" ~/public_html/install/index.php
```

Expected output: Should show the comment line

2. **Check File Size:**
Old file: ~20-25 KB
New file: Similar size (with bypass code)

3. **Check Last Modified:**
Should show today's date after upload


## TROUBLESHOOTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### Still seeing errors after upload?

1. **Clear browser cache completely**
   - Not just cookies, but ALL cached files
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

2. **Check if you uploaded to correct path:**
   - File must be at: public_html/install/index.php
   - NOT at: public_html/core/install/index.php

3. **Verify file permissions on server:**
```bash
chmod 644 ~/public_html/install/index.php
chmod 644 ~/public_html/core/public/install/index.php
```

4. **Check if .htaccess is blocking:**
```bash
cat ~/public_html/.htaccess
# Should not have any deny rules
```


## QUICK CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before claiming "still not working", verify you did:

☐ Uploaded install/index.php to public_html/install/
☐ Uploaded core/public/install/index.php to public_html/core/public/install/
☐ Clicked YES to overwrite existing files
☐ Cleared browser cache completely
☐ Hard refreshed the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
☐ Tried in Incognito/Private mode
☐ Checked that directory permissions are 777:
  ☐ core/bootstrap/cache
  ☐ core/storage
  ☐ core/storage/app
  ☐ core/storage/framework
  ☐ core/storage/logs


## WHY THIS HAPPENS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your local files (on Desktop) ≠ Your server files (on Hostinger)

✅ Local files: Fixed (pushed to GitHub)
❌ Server files: Still old/broken (not uploaded yet)

When you visit eastbridgeatlantic.com/install, it runs the
SERVER files, not your local files!

You must physically UPLOAD the fixed files to the server!
