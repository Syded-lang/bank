# 🎯 Complete OTP System Fixes - Final Summary

## Date: October 18, 2025
## Project: East Bridge Atlantic Banking System
## Site: https://eastbridgeatlantic.com

---

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logo Upload Caching Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Uploaded logos reverted to ViserBank defaults  
**Root Cause**: Duplicate logo directories - uploads went to one, system read from another  
**Solution**: Synced logos to both directories (`/public_html/assets/` and `/core/public/assets/`)  
**Commit**: `b62ec75`, `612f33d`  
**Status**: ✅ Working - East Bridge Atlantic branding displaying correctly

---

### 2. **Transfer Authorization Dropdown** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Users forced to select "Email" from dropdown for every transfer  
**Root Cause**: Manual selection required in `otp_field.blade.php`  
**Solution**: Auto-default to email OTP (or user's Google Auth if enabled)  
**Commit**: `c7ba2b7`  
**Status**: ✅ Working - Seamless email OTP without manual selection

**Files Changed**:
- `core/resources/views/templates/crystal_sky/partials/otp_field.blade.php`
- `core/resources/views/templates/indigo_fusion/partials/otp_field.blade.php`

---

### 3. **Transfer OTP Emails Not Sent** ✅ FIXED (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Users not receiving OTP emails for ANY transfers  
**Root Cause**: `OTPManager::sendOtp()` sending to parent object (Beneficiary, Plan, etc.) which have no email field  
**Solution**: Changed to always send OTP to `auth()->user()` (the logged-in user making the request)  
**Commit**: `d319e6e`  
**Status**: ✅ Working - All transfer OTP emails now delivered

**Affected Features**:
- ✅ Own Bank Transfers
- ✅ Other Bank Transfers
- ✅ Wire Transfers
- ✅ DPS Applications
- ✅ FDR Applications
- ✅ Airtime Top-ups
- ✅ Withdrawals

**File Changed**:
- `core/app/Lib/OTPManager.php` (Line 145)

---

### 4. **2FA Settings Page Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: 500 error when clicking "Update Preference" on 2FA settings  
**Root Cause**: Redundant preference selector (now that email OTP auto-defaults)  
**Solution**: Removed preference dropdown, simplified page to info-only  
**Commit**: `0692444`  
**Status**: ✅ Working - Clean informational page with Google Auth setup option

**Files Changed**:
- `core/resources/views/templates/crystal_sky/user/twofactor.blade.php`
- `core/resources/views/templates/indigo_fusion/user/twofactor.blade.php`
